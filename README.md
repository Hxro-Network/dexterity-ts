## Getting Started

An example of creating a new trading account can be found at examples/create-trg/.

An example market maker script --- TRADE AT YOUR OWN RISK; YOU COULD LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY AND MORE BY RUNNING THIS MARKET MAKER --- can be found at examples/market-maker/. The script is meant to showcase how to place and cancel orders. It is not meant to be a profitable algorithm and, in fact, will lose money in all likelihood.
